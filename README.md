# Hello there, my name is Szabina!

I'm currently studying at Hive Helsinki, a code school that's part of the 42 network. It is:

+ based on peer-to-peer pedagogy: there are no teachers, you collaborate with other students to learn
+ project-driven: no lectures, only increasingly complex, practical projects. Some coding exams to measure progress
+ building foundations on low-level (C, C++) before introducing high-level languages
+ having students give each other code reviews from day one
